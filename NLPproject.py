This has some of the absolute best action sequences in any Star Wars film and it actually has what many of the films have lacked, stakes. Through good characters and terrific acting, Rogue One manages to succeed what most prequels fail to do, enhance the impact of later films. I see myself watching A New Hope through a new point of view and I have to say, Gareth Edwards made a Star Wars movie that stands on its own. Yes it's not a perfect movie, but it's a really good movie with minor flaws.", 'pos'),

However, with second act of the movie this is gone and third one is probably best epic space fight we saw in Star Wars universe ever. The movie does a lot of fanservice, obvious to any SW fan, but which non-fans and first timers would probably didnt even notice (Hammerhead class ship from KoToR), however is funny, quick paced, the plot gets it together in second act and ties up really great at the end, the acting was very well done (especially Donnie Yen). Great movie, go watch, 6.5/10 average by professional critics is absurd.", 'pos'),

It shows what prison life is like at the time which may not be innovative because obviously it has been done before but it still is a movie that is lightened up by the superb and versatile actings of Tim Robbins (Andy Dufrane) and Morgan Freeman (Redd). The movie is sad and long but shows that if you live in prison you are still just trying to live the life you already had. The movie is a jolly tale of friendship, violence (including torture and isolation) and last but not least genius.", 'pos'),

A classic that deserves to be adored for decades to come.", 'pos'),

	 ("Best movie I have seen. Tom Hanks does excellent job as an actor, but the best part of this movie is the way of telling the story. In addition the whole story tells something about the history of USA. This movie has everything.", 'pos'),

	 ("This movie revolutionized my taste in movies. I was 13 when I first saw this film, and it packed a solid punch that left me in a daze for days on end. Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter are all cast to perfection. Pitt in particular is at his personal best. I loved the book by Chuck Pahlaniuk, but I feel that Fincher pumped additional life into the story. It is visionary, innovative, and singular. There have been many attempts to copycat the feeling that this movie created, but it seems like every attempt at touching the greatness of this movie have fallen flat. I don't think that everyone is going to enjoy this movie. I would never watch it with my parents for instance, but it really is great. It was once a cult hit, but it seems to have leaped forward into mainstream pop culture, and I think it deserves the attention.", 'pos'),
	 ("One of the best movies of all times. Of course, the title doesnÂ´t say much, but the story ends up being a wonderful masterpiece. The great antisocial sense only makes it more exciting.", 'pos'),
	 ("A highly underrated film by critics. An excellent film that will keep the viewer grasped in and experience a something completely new. The acting, script, direction, editing and sound are all top notch. There is a lot that can be picked up from this movie, and Fight Club makes you enjoy taking it all in.", 'pos'),
	 ("Fight Club is perhaps one of the most ingenious, pitch perfect films ever made. It hooks you with intense narratives, rocks your world with explosive scenes of extreme intensity, and then shatters your perspective of reality, leaving you at your knees, clapping, and laughing maniacally. It is crafted with the utmost brilliance and is easily one of the greatest films of all time.", 'pos'),
	 ("This movie was amazing, it was hilarious at times, it was gripping, the story was very well done and I was always left anticipating what would happen next, trying to put all the pieces of the non-linear narrative together as a spectator was fun, yes, fun, to do.", 'pos'),
	 ("An excellent adaptation of the book. The small changes are excusable. Characters perform excellently and the story flows and comes together with elegance and class", 'pos'),
	 ("A movie that at first glance looks like some beat-em-up comedy-drama with Brad Pitt, is soooo much more after you watch it. Check it out, although you may have to re-watch it to understand the deeper meaning involved.", 'pos'),
	 ("This Book based movie is a classic. For the person interested in the book, the movie mirrors the book almost identically minus the copy-write changes. This movie does have a man factor to it. However, the metaphor for social injustice is made to a mature aduiance. Its a cult classic!", 'pos'),
	 ("Both dark and hilarious. This film not only delivers great plot of the evolving mind of the narrator (Edward Norton), great performances from Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, it also shows a different view on life and the destruction of the system that we blindly follow.", 'pos'),
	 ("Great movie, some wannabes says its pointless and its but thats just because they want people to think that they know something about movies. This film is genius.", 'pos'),
	 ("it's one of the movies that you get to see once a life-time i loved the story and how anyone can relate to it Edward Norton did an amazing job and it was the first movie that i actually enjoyed brad pitt acting.", 'pos'),
	 ("Slow on the uptake, this film made me a fan of Ed Norton. Obviously the split identity Tyler Durden, played by Pitt, is a perfect outlet for Ed's straight laced character. Call me naive but when I first saw the flick i think I was the last one in the theater to realize the two were the same. Loved the intertwining the making of soap into the storyline as well.", 'pos'),

	 ("One of the most realistic WW2 movies, Saving Private Ryan has everything; a powerhouse cast, smart action, deep character depth, and a poignant sacrifice.", 'pos'),
	 ("A very high quality, which blends extreme action, with a underlying sadness for the disaster that was world war 2. All put together with superb casting.", 'pos'),
	 ("One of Spielberg's greatest movies! The script is amazing and the the acting is great, also one of Tom Hanks' greatest movies. The violence, action and tragedy in the movie really bring out the realism of the war. I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone that can handle some graphic, painful, bloody action.", 'pos'),
	 ("A true work of art and masterpiece in every sense of the word. Maybe it's just because I'm a fan but I don't think I'm being biased when I say that this is one of the greatest motion pictures in the history of the cinema. The only thing that prevents me from giving it a perfect rating is because I feel the graphic detail of violence, however realistic and brutal reminder of how horrific war can be, leaves no room for imagination. But other than that this is an exceptional film.", 'pos'),
	 ("Another masterpiece from Steven Spielberg! He shows the true face war, humanity and veterans! Amazing acting, superb story and great soundtrack from John Williams makes this movie a MUST WATCH!", 'pos'),
	 ("One of the most powerful war movies out there, Saving will hit you with such an emotion for the characters that it feels like you're in their shoes, in that battle zone, fighting for your life. Tom Hanks is at his best in this movie, and Matt Damon is perfect as Private Ryan. If you don't want to watch all of the movie, at least see the first beach scene. It will change your view of... well, everything. It will make you glad to be alive.", 'pos'),
	 ("Perfect War movie.The first 27 minutes are no less than real. It has everything from emotions to acting.Great direction by critically acclaimed Steven Spielberg and superb acting by Tom Hanks aka Capt. John H. Miller.", 'pos'),
	 ("Greatest war movie I have ever seen. It is powerful, moving and keeps you wanting to watch more. Tom Hanks' and Matt Damon's acting is very good and every one of the characters are deep and you feel like you emphasize with them and understand them. Some scenes bend the laws of physics, but it doesn't make any difference. This movie is not for the faint-hearted as it contains some incredibly gory scenes reminiscent on Saw. Awesome film and should stay on every shelf in every house.", 'pos'),
	 ("Saving Private Ryan has to be an all time favourite for everyone who likes war films. I personally enjoyed the movie because of its gripping action scenes and the very moving storyline which shows the bond between soldiers who have been tasked with a near-suicidal mission.

John Travolta was great in Pulp Fiction, but Ray was much, much greater in Goodfellas. Because of his natural intensity, Ray will not get as many parts as some others may, but he still is one of Americas best actors, right up there with Jack, Harvey Keitel, Chris Walken, and Charlie Sheen. (Just kidding about that last one, kids.', 'neg'),
	 ('When I see some of the user reviews here, I can only imagine the studio paid people to post them. This is the most ridiculous movie I have seen in a long time. Oh, comedies should be ridiculous? Not like this. Horrible plot, elements stupid beyond belief (we threatened the gang with a lawsuit, so now I can punch them in the nads?), no funny jokes, poorly executed repetitive slapstick. And one more Hollywood movie thats main selling point is that all men are stupid and secretly half-gay. Any actual biker would find this movie ultimately insulting.', 'neg'),

Homosexuals take a beating here as a daft cop and a prancing thug are the only gay men represented, add in "Deliverence" jokes and this film probably was well-loved by Pat Robertson. I expect Allen, Travolta and Larwrence to do this film, but what is Macy here for? Gosh, he was great in "Fargo."', 'neg'),

If you know what makes a good movie, you agree with me. If the stupidest things take your fancy, then you disagree with me, and like this movie. You wanna see a funny movie? Watch Pineapple Express, or Pulp Fiction. Both those movies over shadow this movie in every single facet.', 'neg'),

It seemed like it was written in one go, and you can literally see the characters barf nonsense exposition at each moment where the writers needed to figure out what to do next. Like watching two six year olds play fantasy cops in the backyard.

There was no reason for Scott Calvin to bring his exwife and her husband to the north pole. they were useless characters and not apart of the story. And worst of all the #1 elf was so annoying with his lisp that I wanted to punch him. The should have paid the money it cost to bring Bernard back for the role. Do not waste your money.
