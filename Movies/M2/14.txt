My main problem with this film is character development. The character development is scarce. The audience is not connected with the characters. And the plot is all cliché (at the end the father-saving-the-child thing is a bad version of that in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2). The acting is okay. Visuals are stunning. Clearly, Disney wants to make this film a cash cow. Ultimately, this film is nothing memorable but a Moana rip-off (remember that animated film?) filled with some just above average jokes. Light to Decent 4.
