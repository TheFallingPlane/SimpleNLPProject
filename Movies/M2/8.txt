It starts off rather interesting, but sadly falls apart only after a few minutes. Items appear without explanation when "the plot requires it", the villain constantly keeps killing random extras to make him look even more "evil" ... now add boring characters and lots of "getting rescued at the last second" moments: That's the whole movie for you.
