One of the worst movies of the year. The performances from the actors are so poor they all just come across as really dislikable, even the iconic characters. The plot is so cliche and boring that I could have easily fell asleep during this movie, and don't even get me started on the villain. The villain is so cliche and predictable that it feel when as if he's just an animatronic on the actual Pirates of the Carribbean ride. Why does this franchise even exist- it's one of the worst ones of this decade.
