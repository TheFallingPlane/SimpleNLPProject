While kinda funny, the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie just rehashes every plot point from the original films. It has enough silly humor and action to make it enjoyable but story wise - it's kinda bland. The new villain was fun and Johnny Depp was the same stupid funny guy, but it was a rehashing of a not so great formula. In the end, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is a fun and stupid movie but bland and cliched story make it less than an average film
