With the "final chapter" marketing and absolute mediocrity of this film, the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise seemingly has come to an end, although not a very fitting one. Fanboys of the Pirates franchise will find some enjoyment out of this film, but for the rest of us, it's almost a complete mess. First off, the plot is wildly redundant to the predecessors in a lame attempt to recapture the glory of the earlier films. It features Jack alongside a young girl and guy (not to be confused with Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann) on a mission while being hunted by the undead (again). While the acting by the recurring actors and new ones is solid, the characters are not. It was quite sad seeing Jack Sparrow devolve into a drunken idiot from a cunning funny pirate in the first three films, while the new characters were forgettable. The producers and directors seemed to have lost touch with what makes Jack great. Secondly, the action is not nearly as engaging, with a lot of the set pieces seemingly pulled from other non-pirates movies. Lastly, the film is far too long and not fun enough. Although it has a few nice moments, Dead Men Tell No Tales is a tale that should not have been told.
