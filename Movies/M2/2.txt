Super fun, high seas adventure with one of the, if not the greatest cinematic pirate of all time, the eternal Captain Jack Sparrow. Admittedly, at this point the films are highly formulaic, and largely predictable, which at the end does drag them down a bit, as little to nothing new is offered. But if you're going to follow a formula, make sure you follow an awesome one, and Pirates certainly delivers on this front.
