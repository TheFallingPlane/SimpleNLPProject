Just terrible. Plot is.....thin. Characters are......thin. Even 2 of the main stars have had enough and managed to escape with just a cameo. Unfortunately, this film attempts to usher in a new generation of pirates, to keep the cash cow ready for another milking. There are literally no redeeming features for this film. It's utterly, utterly, terrible. Just do yourself a favor, and don't watch it. I only went 'cos my kids made me take them.
