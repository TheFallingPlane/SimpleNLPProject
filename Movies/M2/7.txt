I didn't like it. It wasn't funny, it wasn't exciting. It was cliched so much more than anything I've ever seen. I don't think they actually had a writer, rather I think they just filmed random garbage and slung it together. Unless you're obsessed with Depp (is anyone these days?) then I'd avoid this like the plague.
