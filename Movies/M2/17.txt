This movie is missing what made the previous ones great: somewhat complex plots where different characters interact, each with a different motivation. Jack usually interweaves between these motivations with cleverness, negotiation, and some planning. However, In this movie there was no complex plot, the plot didn't make much sense (and contradicted some of the things implied or stated in previous movies), and everyone except the evil antagonist ended up wanting the same object (and to use that object in exactly the same way, making them all allies against the antagonist). Jack has always had scenes where he cleverly plans an escape or series of actions (often surprising bystanders with his ingenuity), but there were no such scenes in this one. Jack sometimes did things that were inexplicable, but these actions were never proven to be particularly intelligent. (Possibly it was meant to be humourous?) Jack spent almost the entire movie imprisoned, tied up, or being chased - unlike other movies, Jack spent almost no time leading anyone anywhere (whether directly as Captain or indirectly as adviser/selective informer).
