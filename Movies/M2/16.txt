Dead men tell no tales is fenomenal to look at, but insufferable to watch. The former stars like Sparrow and Barbossa completely lost their charm and charisma due to an unbearably bad written script. Jack Sparrow used to be a smart and fun character that eventually would amaze his surroundings. But instead in this 5th sequel he turned into an expired pirate who only communicates via short one-liners with no comedic content. This was by far the worst movie I've seen since many years back and it was a complete disappointment.
