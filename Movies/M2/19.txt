There were no significant twists in the plot - it told you almost everything that was going to happen near the beginning; the rest just followed through. The plot revisited William Turner, and showed a number of things about his condition that don't add up with what the previous movies implied. What happened to Will's father? Didn't William have a job to do, that - if he fulfilled it - he wouldn't have any fish-corrosion on him (as Davy Jones did)? In the beginning, isn't William in command of the Dutchman - so why did he act like the crew was going to do some evil thing to William's son (who was visiting)?
