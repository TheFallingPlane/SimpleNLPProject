I am 100% convinced that the positive reviews are written by robots. Those who actually saw this garbage will know that there is not a single redeeming factor in this drek that, bizarrely, copies its big action scenes from other films, like Fast and Furious! I mean, did the directors not see another action film in the past decade? It's all the same stuff, with a terrible script, piss-poor acting and a meandering story. Please, ignore the positive reviews - you'll notice that the writing is a little off, that's because the studios hire foreign (mostly Asian) writers to crack out positive reviews to offset the mostly negative ones done by the critics. This time, the critics are spot on. AVOID THIS TURD! I loved the first three, but the fifth Pirates is actually worse then the fourth one - a feat I thought was impossible.
