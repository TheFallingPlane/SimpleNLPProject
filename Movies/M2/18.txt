I found the antagonist to be distasteful. He seemed to be on a murderous rampage, not caring who got in his way. The story suggests he got a really powerful ship (before being cursed), but it didn't make sense to me. Several ships attacking his all at once should have left a dent, but didn't. The antagonist and his ship, crew, and animals that just happened to be in the area are all cursed for entering an area - but whenever anyone else enters that same area, no curse is applied. After the curse, his ship had strange abilities that make you wonder why these "curses" are always such blessings if you want to be the perfect murdering machines (their abilities were more powerful and varied even than Davy Jones's!) Whereas Blackbeard valued little life other than his own, this captain seems to be thrilled at the idea of killing anyone he deems his enemy (with what I perceive to be inconsistent morals).
