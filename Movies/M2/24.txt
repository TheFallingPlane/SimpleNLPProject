After viewing of Dead Men Tell No Tales I have understood that On Stranger Tides were also not it and bad continuation of original history. In a new part there is no nothing left good from the orinigalny trilogy except the excellent game Johnny Depp. And one actor can't save the movie even if it is the blockbuster. New actors don't cope with the roles, and creators as understood it and have returned also old. The main antagonist - the most boring villain in movies for the last few years. He has neither charisma, nor motives. Why he in general is necessary in the movie? What purposes at him? And the ending is so banal that it seems that the movie obviously for audience of children up to 7-8 years. If Dead Men Tell No Tales restart of a franchise from Disney, then Pirates of the Caribbean have died.
