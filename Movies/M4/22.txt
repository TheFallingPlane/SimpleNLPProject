I do not know what I found most ridiculous in this film, if was was the giant ant man imitating the kung fu panda, or the little truck that grows and explodes, or the spider man mimicking the Empire Strikes Back or the villain, that was certainly the worst villain ever created for a hero film, with the more stupid story ever ... how he would know that the winter soldier had killed the parents of iron man ??? How do he would know the heroes would arrive together in the Syberias base? worst story ever!
