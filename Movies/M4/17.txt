The Russo brothers have done it again!!! Captain America: Civil War like it's previous film Captain America: Winter Soldier, is a very balanced mix of humor, drama, and action, it's just what comic movies are supposed to be like! This film not only stays true to the characters, but also handles multiple characters very well. I loved this movie and I am looking forward to what the brothers have planned for the next Avengers movies in 2018 & 2019.
