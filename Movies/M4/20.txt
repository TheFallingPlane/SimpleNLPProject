'moviecritic68' stated that the younger audience will be uprating this film; well, as a 13 year old whose favourite film at the moment is The Winter Soldier, the follow-up to it was boring. Extremely boring. Whether im being biased/comparing my views on this to that of TWS is irrelevant, because this film didn't strike me as entertaining. It had an interesting premise but didn't deliver it very well. However, the new portrayal of Spider-Man i think was the best since the original Tony Maguire performance, and I liked the inclusion of Black Panther. There were some good fight scenes: most notably the one between Iron Man and Captain America, and a majority of the cinematography was well executed, but overall, it was a very boring film that I had much anticipated. Rather disappointed to be honest.
