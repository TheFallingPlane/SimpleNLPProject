I was really nervous that my expectations were unrealistically high for this movie that I would be disappointed even if the movie was good. However, I am happy to say that I was wrong. This movie really delivered for me. There were intense, serious, darker moments mixed in with hilarious moments. Not to mention the action was top notch. The fight choreography was amazing, on par with the winter soldier, and the airport battle has to be one of the best action scenes of all times. It was honestly incredible. Spider-man and Black Panther were awesome additions to the MCU and I'm excited for their solo movies. Be sure to stay for the two end credit scenes. I cannot wait to see what the Russo Brothers do with Avengers Infinity War!
