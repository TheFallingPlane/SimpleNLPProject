Overall, a very enjoyable addition to the Marvel catalog. That being said, I thought the character playing the new Spiderman was weak, more character development was needed for the Black Panther, and more time dedicated to Captain America given that it is, after all, his film. Finally, the rift between Captain America and Iron man seemed a little too contrived, not painful or long lasting enough to make the needed impression on the audience.
