Literally flawless. The action scenes were amazing. The characters were well written and their motivations were clear. The editing and pacing pretty much impeccable. Excellent humor, especially from Ant-Man and Spider-Man. Fantastic visuals and CGI. I can't find one single bad thing to say about this movie. I guess if you start nitpicking, you'll probably find some flaws. Overall, it was the most entertaining movie I've seen this year. This movie is proof that you can make a great movie regardless of genre.
