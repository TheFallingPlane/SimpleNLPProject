It is as bad as Batman v Superman.To many characters that maybe have given to shine but was underdeveloped and spider-man is pretty much annoying unlike it's predecessors.Black Panther is boring as hell with no charisma.The movie felt so forced,forced to hate each other,forced to fight each other and forced to the avengers to disassemble.With another confusing motives of a villain.Captain America Civil War is the worst Marvel film,and I don't even like Marvel nor DC.The two company just stop making movies and leave the film industry alone.
