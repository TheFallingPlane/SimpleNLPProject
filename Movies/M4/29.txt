Robert Downey Jr is great in this film as always. The action scenes are good and the movie is entertaining and fun for the most part. Problem for me is the act has worn thin. This is Marvel's 14th or 15th film in this universe and they are trying to try to shake things up and try something new but it's become really throwaway popcorn fare. You are entertained while you watch and it's well produced but there is nothing compelling or interesting anymore about the Marvel universe that makes you want to watch it over and over again. I am not really invested or compelled by the characters. There is an effort here to create a conflict. Superheroes governed and monitored by an elite government like agency and the differences between who wants to go fall in with authority and who doesn't. It doesn't really resonate for me. It seems forced. The fun guys trying to be more serious. On a positive note, The new Spiderman has real potential going forward. It might end up being the most entertaining spiderman on film. Kids will love this film. It's easy to follow and fun to watch. Great style, forced substance.
