this is the best Marvel movie to date and is also the best CBM ever since TDK. In fact, the way it leaves you at the end of the movie feels a lot like TDK. In my mind, this is the first chapter of the end of the line that the MCU has been leading up to. And that makes me simultaneously sad that we're approaching the end, but super happy that the end is oh so FANT4STIC!
