Another great release for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and an excellent conclusion to what I think is their strongest lone superhero films: the Captain America trilogy. I believe the first Captain America film was another fun Marvel superhero movie, but with Winter Soldier and now Civil War the bar was certainly raised for the MCU. Within Civil War there is the classic humor, but it still maintains a much more serious and pressing plot, pitting friends against each other and dividing the Avengers team. The film's action is unparalleled as far as the rest of the Marvel films and Downey's Iron Man performance as well as Evans and the rest of the cast's acting is great. I thought the creators did a very good job of letting all the superheroes have their moments of glory, as well as introducing new players like Black Panther and Spider-man (both awesome), while still keeping the primary focus on Captain America and his loyalty to Bucky, his lifelong friend. A must-see for general movie fans, not just superhero fans. 8.5/10. Side note: the airport scene is incredible.
