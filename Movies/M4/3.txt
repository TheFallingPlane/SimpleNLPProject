Captain America: Civil War is essentially the current culmination of what has transpired in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) since 2008 with the release of Iron Man 1, pitting two heroes, Captain America and Iron Man, against one another in a battle of personal beliefs and morals. However, these are not the only players involved in this superhero extravaganza, with Captain America being joined by the Winter Soldier, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man and Hawkeye, and Iron Man teaming up with War Machine, Black Widow, Vision, and newly introduced, Black Panther and Spiderman. Civil War is definitely the most intense and mature of all the MCU films and what the Russo's (directors) really grasped well is creating an environment where we as the audience can invest and care for these heroes on an emotional level, which is testament to what the MCU has done with all these well-developed characters. Throughout all these years, we have seen all these characters evolve, not just as heroes but as people. The histories of both Steve Rogers and Tony Stark are central to the story that develops in Civil War, and the events that ensue creates the division within the Avengers, as well as the people watching the film unfold. This also helps our villain, Zemo, increase his influence on the audience, because as invested viewers, whether you picked a side or not, no-one wants the villain to achieve his goal. With great writing, great directing and great acting, this film acts on what it intends to achieve superbly, creating the best Marvel film seen to date.
