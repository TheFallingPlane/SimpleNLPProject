If you want a movie with lots of fist fights this is your movie. The movie starts weak then goes downhill from there. Some of the basic components of any good story were left out: Rising Action...nope, the highest level was in the middle. Something at stake... nope, never felt any one or any ideas was at risk except their moodiness. Any dimension to the characters, nope... they were all caricatures, without anything beneath the surface. The Russo Brothers use to know what to do but I'm thinking the studio or producers took control or these guys have really lost it. The acting was the only thing that saved the film - though I lost a bit of respect for most of the actors for selling out (yes, they are crying all the way to the bank). Robert Downey Jr. use to be able to act, his one dimensional character was the most cliche because he was overacting most of the time. The first act is probably the worst, it was all over the map with political statements and cliche dialogue. It was like they took the headlines in mass media today and put them in a blender and then stuck them in this movie. I am more than disappointed, I feel downright cheated. The critics should be ashamed for their high reviews. This is one more nail in the Marvel coffin before we all stop going. After this movie you can forget me going to X-men. I will wait for Doctor Strange that hopefully has something more than this...
