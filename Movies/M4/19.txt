Really getting bored of these now, but possibly not as bored as RDJ and Chris Evans look in one of the most crushingly bland films you'll ever see. To be fair, its better than BvS but that's the only positive thing I can say about this. Spider-Man is just flat out irritating and the way he is shoehorned into the story is horrible. Black Panther is just - nothing. Every 'joke' fell flat with the half empty audience I watched it with, and I've never seen so many punters take a loo break, and no one seemed to be saying nice things on the way out so don't think I'm alone in my thinking. Kids will be bored to tears until the airport scene. Admittedly, that scene will entertain the young, but they'll probably be asleep or on their smartphones by the time it arrives
