"Civil War" was the usual fun superhero movie that Disney has been giving us for the past few years, except maybe a bit darker in tone BUT that doesn't mean the film lacked the humor seen in previous films. This was certainly the superhero movie I needed to see after watching the boring and depressing idiocracy known as "Batman V Superman"...
