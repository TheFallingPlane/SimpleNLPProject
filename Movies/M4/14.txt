Captain America Civil War is the best Marvel Comic Book movie to date. I can not repeat how much I enjoyed this movie. The hype train did not derail, so glad this movie surpassed my expectations. The Russo brothers just get it, they have cracked the da vinci code to making great comic book movies. I can now say without doubt that Infinity Wars is in safe hands. My mind was blown. I'm gonna have to watch it in the theatre at least 4 more times. 5/5 stars, I recommend everyone to go watch this movie on the biggest screen in your city.
