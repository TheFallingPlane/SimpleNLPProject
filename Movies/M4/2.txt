Marvel are experts at a very smart trick. They make movies so convoluted and action packed that there is no way a viewer can grasp the totally of what's going on in one or even two viewings. Nice way to get repeat ticket sales. But they are deserved in this case. This movie cost a fortune and you can see it. The action, cinematography and CGI is out of this world. The story-line is believable enough and not too complicated and we get to travel to numerous different locations, (Nigeria,Leipzig, Berlin, Antarctica) and destroy them. Usual cast of thousands ( Everyone seems to have a role on this even Martin Freeman, Its a like a charity for actors) and uber fast dialogue with a top class airport fight scene to keep everyone happy. Best Captain America to date...
