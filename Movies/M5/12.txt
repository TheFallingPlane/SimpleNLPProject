This movie has hit all points at the highest level. It was hilarious at some points while still being heartwrenching at others. It portrayed all of the MCU characters very well and gave all of them major rolls in the story while not overpowering any one of them. This movie took major risks and I believe that Marvel executed it to perfection.
