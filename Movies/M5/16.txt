I gave it a two because that's how many laughs I got out of this movie. It was predictable, bland, disappointing, and even the ACTION was boring. There are several characters that should've been in this film, but they were conveniently ignored (or brought into the end clip, nice job). The heroes that did have the spotlight made stupid/weak decisions and so did I for believing this would be a good film. I never thought I'd say this, but that was the worst Marvel film I've ever seen.
