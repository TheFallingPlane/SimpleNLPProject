Avengers Infinity War is another gamble of sort by Marvel Studios. It is an astonishing film that assumes that you have seen and is a fan of the 18 MCU films before it. It is not a film that can stood by itself, It is a culmination of 10 years worth of 'hard work', interconnected story lines, multiple characters that define the MCU. It is also a film that shows us that Marvel is so way above the curve in comparison to other studios that tries to establish an inter connected universe. It also ends in a gut wrenching third act that segue in the 4th, yet untitled Avengers film. Believe me, things will go bad, with many comparing this to the level of Empire Strikes Back. Acting wise: Josh Brolin is an absolute stand out as Thanos, the main villain. He is the best villain the whole MCU. The rest of the casts are no slouch either, balancing humor and tragedy in equal measure. The action sequences are also astonishing, with a higher stake: our heroes can and will die in this installment. An absolute classic that ranks as the best MCU flick by far.
