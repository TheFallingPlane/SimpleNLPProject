The film offers humorous and fun moments by teaming up several of the cast members together, but it also completely breaks your heart and soul with some truly unexpected, dark and shocking turns. It's also a large scale production, with the Russo brothers offering their best directing yet. As a whole, this manages to top my personal list of MCU films and comic book based films in general, giving the promise of the next chapter to be even greater, if possible.
