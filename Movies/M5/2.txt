Marvel definitely has now solved their villain problem. I thought I had this film all figured out since usually all MCU films have a rather predictable formula. Nothing wrong with that though. This film throws the formula away and changes things up in many ways. This was a great breathe of fresh air in terms of storytelling. Yes the marvel trademarks are there still but the waybthe film was structured was far different that other MCU films prior and this is why it’s very special. The 3rd act was the epitome of a nail biter and the ending shocked even me a long time Marvel comics fans. I didn’t think they’d a tully do what they did. The entire film was a rollercoaster ride. A must see!!!
