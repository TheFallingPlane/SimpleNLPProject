A kids' show. Everything (well, everything = the CGI-fest that this movie is) is so colourful and campy, the fights so phoney, the drama so unconvincing, and the plot so dumb (read: "non existant") and predictable, that Idonteven. Not sure if a movie or a very long and boring cutscene from some R12 videogame.
