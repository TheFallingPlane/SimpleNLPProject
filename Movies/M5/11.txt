This is not a standard superhero movie. Nearly all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies from the past ten years have led up to this one. So you should watch all of those before you start watching Infinity War. Because this movie doesn't give you time to breath and catch up. Loads of characters, settings, items, references of which the movie assumes that you are familiar with them. It's a rollercoaster that doesn't let up. After preparing for ages, Thanos is making his last moves. He is coming. Dread it, run from it, destiny still arrives. Dread. That word actually describes this movie really well. From the very first scene you already know that the stakes are enormous, the threat is immediate and all encompassing, and stopping Thanos truly feels like the greatest challenge in the universe. There are still jokes, heartfelt moments, marvelous special effects and hilarious jokes. Like you would expect from any MCU movie. And amazing special effects, scenery, tech ...There are loads of characters and none of them get a lot of screen time, yet there's still character development (naturally not for all of them, not even for all heroes).
