An absolute mess in terms of plot, thematic development, and characters. This kind of shows what a massive influence on modern pop culture Game of Thrones has been, but also shows that it takes filmmakers with a far more deft hand than the Russo Brothers' to pull it off. It's still pretty enjoyable for the most part, but its an absolute tonal mess, and really doesn't have the guts to do much original.
