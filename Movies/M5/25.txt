The Avengers: Infinity War is like watching your favorite team fail ending after ending and eventually losing the game 0 - 5. The only redeeming points of the movie is the edge of your seat action and the moral discussion that the movie poses. As the final credits began to roll I was left with the question; What is the value of life and who gets to decide who lives or dies. History is full of people who assumed they were qualified to make that decision. Now there’s an alien that thinks the way to save the galaxies is to eliminate half of it's population.
