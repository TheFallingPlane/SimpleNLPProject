ah, the MCU is back with more mediocre movies after they ruined Norse mythology characters in Thor "ragnarok" we are with another movie with cringy dialogue, no story and just random stuff happening and not to spoil but this movie is pretty much just an ad fro avengers 4 which i will not make the mistake of watching in theaters. i feel like the only good superhero movies we have gotten are LOGAN and The Dark Knight trilogy.
