This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's more than just one bad movie. It ruins the entire MCU. I'll never be able to enjoy re-watching any previous movie in the MCU now that I've seen this movie. I hate spoilers, but I wish somebody had spoiled this movie for me, because then I would have known to avoid watching it. I get what they were trying to do. They very artfully succeeded in accomplishing exactly what they were trying to do. I PASSIONATELY HATE WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO DO. An escapist fantasy movie in the MCU was not the place for it! This movie ruined everything!
