A lot of people seem to like this movie, and I'm not gonna begrudge them that. I don't see why they like it, but, y'know, that's their business. But I can't recommend this slog to anybody, not even when I factor in the bits that I really, really liked. And it's definitely one to avoid if you have certain phobias.
