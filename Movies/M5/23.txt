I cannot see why this movie has a good rating. I cringed the entire movie from start to finish. The story is weak, the CGI very unimpressive and obvious in places. I felt ashamed of myself for watching this and gave up half way through. Recommend you swerve this entire genre which is what I will be doing from now on
