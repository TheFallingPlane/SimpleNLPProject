These Marvel movies are all comedies now, not adventures played seriously but sometimes laced with humor as was the standard before. It's all one liner driven with some of it slyly funny yes, but that's so easy compared to story craft which in this overlong bloated padded bore of cliché laden recycled over-the-top ludicrous nonsense is slight. What unpredictability exists is too little too late, and the unusually unbearable amount of silly flat-footed time filler introductions by each of the too many characters all thrown together in such a clunky 8 year old mentality kind of way it makes the word contrived seem too lofty for this level of brain drain.
