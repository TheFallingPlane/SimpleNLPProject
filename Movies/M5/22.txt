This is the worst piece of crap movie, with mindless violence, no sense at all in the whole movie and an absolute waste of 3 hrs and not mention, my precocious $10 *4 , as I had my wife and kids with me. In the end the movie said thanos will be back, but I definitely won't, other than the special effects, there is nothing in the movie, the hype is useless , please don't waste u'r money and time going to this **** show. My younger son keeps convincing me that it makes sense and I should understand more about the super heroes, there are some boring conversations with dark backgrounds, which put me into a glorious sleep and I had to be woken up by my wife, who was also falling asleep from time to time. I have been more displeased only in one other indian movie, which I was conned into going to.
