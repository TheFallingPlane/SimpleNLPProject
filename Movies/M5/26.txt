What a mess. I realize that a LOT of people loved this movie. Sorry, but I don't appreciate any movie that ends the way this one did and makes me wait another year or more to get to a conclusion. All the way home, I was having Star Wars - Empire Strikes Back flashbacks. STILL one of my least favorite movies because of the lack of resolution and "cliffhangers". You KNOW that the "ending" is not really the "ending". I felt like I wasted my time.
