Obvious. Not surprising. Consequences clearly are not permanent. Only Spidey, Strange, and Iron Man (who worked together apart from the other heroes for most of the movie) were interesting. The rest of the film was ponderous, depressing, obvious and slow. I really wish I had saved my time and money.
